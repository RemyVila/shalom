Whats up you little babies, we are going to be creating a little website here today. This is going to have like 3 pages. Home page, About page, Contact page.
I dont know, this is just going to be a fun little project we are going to try and get done tonight.

## Homepage
The homepage is going to consist of a background image and a call to action button that will lead to the contact page and yeah... idk thats it be creative
Below the homepage there is going to be a section where it will be pulling api material from a special API that we will use

## About page
the about page is going to be a little description about what this project is which this is:
*This us just a small littl project that shows that we know how to use the link tag and route and switch at the same time an api that will show some character stuff and geto DB that will post some poeple that had managed to get to the contact page*

## contact page
Its basically a forum - person completes it - their name profile image - and message and it will be posted below the forum.


## what will we use
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - for getting and pushing requests?
- [styledcompents](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics) - to style the compenents
- [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) - to validate the forms
- [*rick and morty api*](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) for the homepage api


And yeah i think that is it
